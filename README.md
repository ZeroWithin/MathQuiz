**MathQuiz** is my first actual attempt at coding; written in *Lua*, language I am learning as my first programming language.<br/>This code's goal is, as its name implies, to create a little math game. The concept is simple: each question answered correctly adds 1 point to your score, and each question answered incorrectly subtracts 1 point. If 5 questions are answered correctly in a row, you receive a bonus of 1 point, but if a question is answered incorrectly, your streak resets.<br/>I intend to expand this into something a bit more complex as time goes on, within the limits of what Lua can offer me.<br/>***Hope you enjoy this!***<br/>**OBS.:** To run this file as intended, you'll need Lua downloaded in *Program Files* and run the file through a *terminal* of your preference.
